## TradingAgents Framework

TradingAgents is a multi-agent trading framework that mirrors the dynamics of real-world trading firms. By deploying specialized LLM-powered agents: from fundamental analysts, sentiment experts, and technical analysts, to trader, risk management team, the platform collaboratively evaluates market conditions and informs trading decisions. Moreover, these agents engage in dynamic discussions to pinpoint the optimal strategy.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/schema.png" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</p>

> TradingAgents framework is designed for research purposes. Trading performance may vary based on many factors, including the chosen backbone language models, model temperature, trading periods, the quality of data, and other non-deterministic factors. [It is not intended as financial, investment, or trading advice.](https://tauric.ai/disclaimer/)

Our framework decomposes complex trading tasks into specialized roles. This ensures the system achieves a robust, scalable approach to market analysis and decision-making.

### Analyst Team
- Fundamentals Analyst: Evaluates company financials and performance metrics, identifying intrinsic values and potential red flags.
- Sentiment Analyst: Aggregates news headlines, StockTwits, and Reddit chatter into a single sentiment read to gauge short-term market mood.
- News Analyst: Monitors global news and macroeconomic indicators, interpreting the impact of events on market conditions.
- Technical Analyst: Utilizes technical indicators (like MACD and RSI) to detect trading patterns and forecast price movements.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/analyst.png" width="100%" style="display: inline-block; margin: 0 2%;">
</p>

### Researcher Team (Tree-of-Thoughts)
- Bullish and bearish researchers critically assess the Analyst Team's insights. Each runs a **Tree-of-Thoughts** search — generating, scoring, and expanding multiple lines of argument — and grounds its "technical intuition" in the **real historical win rate** of the technical signals it cites (computed by a backtest over price history). Hallucinated signals are dropped before the case reaches the Judge.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/researcher.png" width="70%" style="display: inline-block; margin: 0 2%;">
</p>

### Judge (final verdict)
- A single **Judge** is the sole decision authority (the old Trader, risk-management team, and Portfolio Manager are removed). The Judge **verifies** the researchers' claims against the technical and fundamental reports, **checks feasibility** of their intuition via web search and the historical dataset, **weights** each metric, and builds a **scoreboard** from which the final rating is derived. Every analysis — its scoreboard, cited signals, and verdict — is written to a SQLite dataset whose realised outcomes are resolved on later runs and feed back into the feasibility check.

</p>

## Installation and CLI

### Installation

Clone TradingAgents:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TauricResearch/TradingAgents.git
cd TradingAgents
```

Create a virtual environment in any of your favorite environment managers:
```bash
conda create -n tradingagents python=3.13
conda activate tradingagents
```

Install the package and its dependencies:
```bash
pip install .
```

### Docker

Alternatively, run with Docker:
```bash
cp .env.example .env  # add your API keys
docker compose run --rm tradingagents
```

For local models with Ollama:
```bash
docker compose --profile ollama run --rm tradingagents-ollama
```

### Required APIs

TradingAgents supports three OpenAI-compatible LLM providers. Set the key for the one you use (Ollama needs none):

```bash
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=...         # DeepSeek (default)
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=...       # OpenRouter
export ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY=...    # Alpha Vantage (optional data vendor)
```

For local models, pick **Ollama** in the CLI/web (or `llm_provider: "ollama"`). The default endpoint is `http://localhost:11434/v1`; set `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` to point at a remote `ollama-serve`. Pull models with `ollama pull <name>` and enter the model name when prompted.

Alternatively, copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your keys:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### CLI Usage

Launch the interactive CLI:
```bash
tradingagents          # installed command
python -m cli.main     # alternative: run directly from source
```
You will see a screen where you can select your desired tickers, analysis date, LLM provider, research depth, and more.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/cli/cli_init.png" width="100%" style="display: inline-block; margin: 0 2%;">
</p>

An interface will appear showing results as they load, letting you track the agent's progress as it runs.

## TradingAgents Package

### Implementation Details

The agent runtime is built on **AutoGen 0.4** (`autogen-agentchat`). LangChain/LangGraph have been removed; the only LLM layer is one OpenAI-compatible client supporting **DeepSeek, OpenRouter, and Ollama** (`tradingagents/autogen_clients/`). Defaults: `deepseek-reasoner` for the Tree-of-Thoughts researchers and the Judge's reasoning; `deepseek-chat` for the tool-using analysts and the Judge's tool turns. The pipeline is a deterministic async flow — analysts → bull/bear ToT debate → Judge verdict — orchestrated in `tradingagents/graph/orchestrator.py`.

### Web UI

A browser console is included alongside the CLI:

```bash
python -m webapp          # or: tradingagents-web   → http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

- **Top**: search any stock/index by name or symbol (case-insensitive, autocompletes the ticker) with a price chart over 5D / 1W / 1M / 3M / 1Y / 5Y / MAX.
- **Left**: a live agent-coordination graph — a glowing marker carries a summarized topic from each agent to the next as stages complete.
- **Right**: a streaming output window with each agent's full report, the Judge's scoreboard, and a weighted-score bar.

### Python Usage

To use TradingAgents inside your code, you can import the `tradingagents` module and initialize a `TradingAgentsGraph()` object. The `.propagate()` function will return a decision. You can run `main.py`, here's also a quick example:

```python
from tradingagents.graph.trading_graph import TradingAgentsGraph
from tradingagents.default_config import DEFAULT_CONFIG

ta = TradingAgentsGraph(debug=True, config=DEFAULT_CONFIG.copy())

# forward propagate
_, decision = ta.propagate("NVDA", "2026-01-15")
print(decision)
```

You can also adjust the default configuration to set your own choice of LLMs, debate rounds, etc.

```python
from tradingagents.graph.trading_graph import TradingAgentsGraph
from tradingagents.default_config import DEFAULT_CONFIG

config = DEFAULT_CONFIG.copy()
config["llm_provider"] = "deepseek"           # DeepSeek only in this build
config["deep_think_llm"] = "deepseek-reasoner"  # ToT researchers + Judge reasoning
config["quick_think_llm"] = "deepseek-chat"     # tool-using analysts + Judge tools
config["max_debate_rounds"] = 2               # bull/bear Tree-of-Thoughts rounds

ta = TradingAgentsGraph(debug=True, config=config)
_, decision = ta.propagate("NVDA", "2026-01-15")
print(decision)
```

See `tradingagents/default_config.py` for all configuration options.

## Persistence and Recovery

TradingAgents persists two kinds of state across runs.

### Decision log (markdown)

The decision log is always on. Each completed run appends its verdict to `~/.tradingagents/memory/trading_memory.md`. On the next run for the same ticker, TradingAgents fetches the realised return (raw and alpha vs SPY), generates a one-paragraph reflection, and injects the most recent same-ticker decisions plus recent cross-ticker lessons into the **Judge**'s context, so each analysis carries forward what worked and what didn't.

Override the path with `TRADINGAGENTS_MEMORY_LOG_PATH`.

### Analysis dataset (SQLite)

Every analysis is also recorded in a structured SQLite store at `~/.tradingagents/cache/analysis_store.db` (override with `analysis_store_path`, or the base dir with `TRADINGAGENTS_CACHE_DIR`): the Judge's scoreboard, the technical signals the researchers cited with their backtested win rates, the final verdict, and — resolved on later same-ticker runs — the realised return/alpha. The Judge queries this dataset (`lookup_signal_history`, `lookup_past_analyses`) when checking whether the researchers' technical intuition is feasible.

> The LangGraph checkpoint-resume feature (`--checkpoint`) has been removed in the AutoGen rearchitecture.
